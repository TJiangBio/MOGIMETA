# MetaGXplore: Pan-cancer Patient Metastasis Identification with Deep Learning and Multi-omics
### Major version 0.1.1
## Overview 
MetaGXplore (Integrating Multi-Omics Data with Graph convolutional networks for Pan-cancer Patient METAstasis Identification) is a novel deep learning model that represents the first attempt to integrate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) with multi-omics pan-cancer data for predicting metastasis.

### Objective
Our goal is for MetaGXplore to assist professionals make treatment decision when predict the rish of metastasis for a specific patient. In addition, to enhance the interpretability of MetaGXplore, we employed the Graph Mask and Feature Mask methods from GNNExplainer. 

### Use and distribution
In general, we recommend testing and using MetaGXplore with  patient multi-omics data.

### Installation
